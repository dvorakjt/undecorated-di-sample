# undecorated-di Sample App

This is a sample application which employs undecorated-di to power dependency injection and inversion of control. This application illustrates:

 - Basic usage of the undecorate-di package
 - The type-safety provided by undecorated-di
 - Polymorphic behavior made possible with undecorated-di
 - Suggested file structure / organization of classes, interfaces and interface keys when using the project

To experiment with this simple example, clone the repo and CD into the application folder. Run:

    npm install

Take a moment to review the TypeScript files and notice the type-safety and polymorphic behavior provided by the package, as well as the suggested file structure.

To run the sample application, first run:

    npm run build

Then:

    npm run start
    
Happy dependency injecting!
